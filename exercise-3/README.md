# Exercise 3 - Using Github

## :bulb: Goals for Exercise 3

When working on systems that need to be operational at all times, pull requests and code reviews are important tools. By creating a pull request, you get to describe changes, and your colleagues can participate in discussions and suggest improvements. Additionally, it serves as a good documentation mechanism for why a change was made.

This is an open exercise. The goal is for you to spend time getting familiar with how to create pull requests, write comments, and perform a pull request review.

### 3.1 Creating a Pull Request

:pencil2: Check out a new branch with an appropriate name. Create a new file with some content, and commit it to the branch. Push the branch to the remote repository.

:pencil2: Create a pull request in Github.
Familiarize yourself with how you can write comments, and perform approval/rejection of pull requests.

:pencil2: Merge the pull request into `main`.
